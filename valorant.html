            <h1>Valorant</h1>
              <p>Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near-future. Players assume the control of agents, characters who come from a plethora of countries and cultures around the world.
                In the main game mode, players join either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities and use an economic system to purchase their abilities and weapons.
                The game has an assortment of weapons including sidearms, submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Automatic and semi-automatic weapons such as the "Spectre" and "Odin"
                have recoil patterns which have to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately. In the standard game mode, the match is played over 24 rounds, and the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match.
                The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike, which they need to plant on a site. If the attacking team successfully protects the Spike and it detonates, they get a point. If the defending team successfully
                defuses the Spike, or the 100-second round timer expires, the defending team gets a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated, the opposing team earns a point. After twelve rounds,
                the attacking team switches to the defending team and vice versa. If a match ends with a 12-12 score, a sudden death round is added (with no side switching taking place).[2][7][4]
                In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played over 7 rounds, so the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. To further reduce the gameplay's length,
                loadouts are random every round and every attacking player carries the spike that they can plant at any site.

            <h1> Brawlhalla </h1>
              <p> Brawlhalla is a free-to-play 2D fighting game developed by Blue Mammoth Games for Microsoft Windows,
                  macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch with full cross-play across all platforms.
                  The game was shown at PAX East in April 2014, and went into alpha later that month. An open beta became available in November 2015,
                  followed by the game's release in October 2017. As of June 2020, the game features 49 playable characters, called "Legends",
                  as well as numerous crossover "skins" that serve as crossover characters from other franchises. On March 5, 2018,
                  Brawlhalla developer-publisher Blue Mammoth Games was acquired by video game publisher Ubisoft. As a result of this,
                  Rayman joined as a playable character on November 6, 2018, the day the game was released for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One.
                  On July 6, 2018, Ars Technica released an article detailing precise player counts for Steam games obtained through a leak as a result of a "hole" in its API.
                  This leak showed Brawlhalla to be ranked 24th in player count on Steam with a total of 8,646,824 players, out of all games featuring the Steam Achievements system.
                  Ubisoft reported more than 20 million players by February 2019.

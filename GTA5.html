            <h1> Grand Theft Auto V </h1>
              <p> Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games.
                  It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV.
                  Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California,
                  the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency and powerful crime figures.
                  The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
                  The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle.
                  Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions.
                  The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay.
                  A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes.
                  Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.

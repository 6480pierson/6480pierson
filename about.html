<h1> About us </h1>
<section About Huib>
  <h2> About Huib </h2>
    <p class="about"> Hello I am Huib. I'm 15 years old and I'm one of the members of TheBetterPlayer(TBP).
        I live in the Netherlands in the province Noord-Brabant. I go to school on the Havo in the capital of Noord-Brabant, Den Bosch.
        I love playing video games, watching movies and editing. My favorite game of all time is Minecraft since it has the most amount of possibilities to have fun.
        For my favorite movie, I have to pick Finding Nemo since I used to watch it alot when I was younger. I love this friendgroup, because next to the fact
        that we are always having fun, we share really similar interests which is why we can talk all day, every day.

<section About Ralf>
  <h2>About Ralf</h2>
    <p class="about"> Hello there, I'm Ralf. I'm 16 and one of the members of TheBetterPlayer(TBP). I live in the Netherlands in the province Noord-Brabant. One of the things I do is just to be good at video games.
        I pick up on things pretty fast and am quick to adapt. I love video games and I even got a new pc this year which I build myself. I also play football as a hobby. This friendgroup is amazing.
        We get to do a lot of games because we like to find new video games to explore. We are currently trying the games ARK and Dauntless two amazing games where you get to play with friends and cooperate with eachother.
        Where this friendgroup would be over 3 years? I have no idea but we try to make the most out of every thing that we do together.

<section About Orlando>
  <h2>About Orlando</h2>
    <p class="about"> Hello, my name is Orlando and I'm 15 years old, I'm the youngest member of TheBetterPlayer(TBP). I live in the Netherlands with my parents and my older brother.
      I have a lot of things I like to do, for example making art, cooking, and of course playing video games.
      I would say my favorite games are Minecraft, Rocket league and Werewolf online, which is a mobile game.
      Lately I've been trying out new games like Valorant and new genres like MMORPG's and speedrunning.
      I think i am decent at almost any game but I don't really accel at a specific one.
      The thing i really love about this friendgroup is how we can play with or without eachother but still have conversations, no matter how stupid they may be.
